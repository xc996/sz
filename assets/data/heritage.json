The left camp was the original Dapeng Camp with 505 soldiers, and the right camp was stationed in Dongchong Fortress with 482 soldiers.\nIn the 20th year of Daoguang (1840), due to the prevalence of opium smuggling and the increasing threat from the British, the Dapeng Camp was upgraded to a brigade, with an additional deputy general stationed in Kowloon.\nIn the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), the Kowloon area was transferred to British rule, and some of the Dapeng Brigade's stations were within British territory, so they were abandoned.\nIn the 8th year of Tongzhi (1869), the left camp had 430 soldiers and the right camp had 320 soldiers.\nIn the 24th year of Guangxu (1898), the British leased the New Territories and outlying islands, and all the stations of the brigade were within British territory, so it was also abolished.\nIn the 25th year of Guangxu (1899), the Qing soldiers in Kowloon Walled City were expelled by the British, so both camps of the brigade were also abolished.\nAt about 16:00 on June 15, 2024, a small-scale collapse occurred on the south gate wall of Dapeng Fortress in Shenzhen. Emergency, cultural, and street office departments of Dapeng New District rushed to the scene immediately for disposal.
